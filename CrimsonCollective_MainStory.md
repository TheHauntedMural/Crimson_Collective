## Crimson Collective Main Story ## 
What if...there was an organization of nurses who operate secretly outside the law to secure blood transfusions or organ donors from unsuspecting matches? 

Deep within the sterile halls of St. Genesis Medical Center, a shadowy group of elite nurses known as The Crimson Collective operates under the radar. 
Their mission? To ensure that critically ill patients receive life-saving blood transfusions and organ donations at any cost — even if it means breaking every law designed to protect patient privacy.

Using insider knowledge and stolen medical records, the organization creates a covert network that allows it to match donors with patients more quickly than any government system could. 
The nurses breach HIPAA regulations by breaking ethical rules, breaking into databases, and abusing their vast medical knowledge to save lives. 
They leave no digital trace and never claim credit for their work — until one small error reveals their identity.

An investigative journalist discovers the existence of the Crimson Collective after a well-known patient passes away unexpectedly while pursuing a trail of stolen medical information. 
But when she looks further, she finds evidence of a criminal network within the hospital that extends well beyond organ trafficking, not just a bunch of renegade nurses. 
Now that her life is in jeopardy, she must choose between joining the Crimson Collective on their dangerous journey or exposing them and risking countless lives.

"They bent the rules to save lives — now someone’s ready to bury them for it."
