# Crimson_Collective
Hello everyone! Welcome to my repository for my Thought Experiment! I decided to do something a bit darker and thriller-like in tone because I find those genres interesting. 
Everything you are looking for should be underneath the files I will label (such as CrimsonCollective_MainStory or CrimsonCollective_Characters).
I am incredibly new to GitHub, so please let me know if you cannot access anything. You can email me at gc619@lindenwood.edu
I'll see if I can fix the problem or send you a PDF or docx file. Below is a master list of the different files; they are in no particular order. 

Most importantly, have fun! :D 

1. Crimson-Collective Main Story
2. Crimson-Collective Characters
3. Crimson-Collective Geography and or Setting
4. Crimson-Collective Morals and or Psychology
5. Crimson-Collective Laws
