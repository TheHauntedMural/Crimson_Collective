# Crimson_Collective
Hello everyone! Welcome to my repository for my Thought-Experiment! I decided to do something a bit darker and thriller in tone because I find those genres interesting. 
Everything you are looking for should be underneath the different pages and or files that I will label (such as CrimsonCollective_MainStory or CrimsonCollective_Characters).
I am extremely new to GitHub so please let me know if you cannot access anything. You can email me at gc619@lindenwood.edu
I'll see if I can fix the problem or send you a PDF or docx file. You can also find a masterlist below of the different files, they are in no particular order. 

Most importantly, have fun! :D 

1. Crimson-Collective Main Story
2. Crimson-Collective Characters
3. Crimson-Collective Culture
4. Crimson-Collective Geography and or Setting
5. Crimson-Collective Morals and or Psychology
6. Crimson-Collective Laws
