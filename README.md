# Crimson_Collective
Hello everyone! Welcome to my repository for my Thought Experiment! I decided to do something a bit darker and thriller-like in tone because I find those genres interesting. 
Everything you are looking for should be underneath the files I will label (such as CrimsonCollective_MainStory or CrimsonCollective_Characters).
I am incredibly new to GitHub, so please let me know if you cannot access anything. You can email me at gc619@lindenwood.edu
I'll see if I can fix the problem or send you a PDF or docx file. Below is a master list of the different files; they are in no particular order. 

Most importantly, have fun! :D 

1. [Crimson-Collective Main Story](CrimsonCollective_MainStory.md)
2. [Crimson-Collective Characters](CrimsonCollective_Characters.md)
3. [Crimson-Collective Geography and or Setting](CrimsonCollective_Geography.md)
4. [Crimson-Collective Morals and or Psychology](CrimsonCollective_Morals)
5. [Crimson-Collective Laws](CrimsonCollective_Laws.md)
