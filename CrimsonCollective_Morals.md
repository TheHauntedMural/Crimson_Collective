## Crimson Collective Oath ## 
"In times of darkness, when life flickers faintly and hope wanes, we stand as guardians of survival, bound not by the laws of men but by the sacred vow to preserve life at all costs."

> ### To Carry the Burden Together ###
we share this sacred burden with our sisters and brothers, knowing the cost of our actions. We pledge never to betray one another, for we stand united by the lives we save and the choices we make. 

> ### To Prioritize Life Over Protocol ###
We pledge to act when conventional pathways fail, seeking blood or organ matches outside legal limits if necessary, for the preservation of life stands above all. When time is scarce, and the law slows our ability to save, we choose to act swiftly, without hesitation.

> ### To Search Where Others Cannot ###
With the power granted to us through patient records, databases, and confidential information, we vow to search every corner of the medical system for compatible donors, even if it means violating privacy. These records are to be used only for the purposes of healing patients, absolutely nothing else.

> ### To Operate in Silence and Secrecy ###
We will never expose those whose private information we uncover, nor allow our actions to be traced back to the patients we serve. No family, patient, or donor shall ever know of the breach we commit in their name, and we will carry the weight of these decisions in silence.

> ### To Act as Guardians of Last Resort ###
We shall break these rules only when all legal and ethical means have been exhaustedâ€”when no donor can be found in time, when no blood is available through legitimate sources, when life hangs by a thread and there is no other option.
