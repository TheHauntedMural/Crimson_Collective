## St. Genesis Medical Center ## 
St. Genesis Medical Center stands proud at the heart of a suburban neighboorhood. Its cheerful white exterior and cultivated flower beds present a welcoming facade. Colorful banners proclaim "Your Health, Our Priority!" as you approach the automatic sliding doors. The spacious lobby greets visitors with plush seating and a bubbling fish tank. Smiling receptionists, their eyes never quite meeting yours, offer assistance from behind spotless plexiglass barriers. A light breeze carries the faint scent of disinfectant, mingling oddly with the sweet fragrance of blooming flowers. As the sun begins to set, shadows stretch across the grounds, and the cheery white walls take on a sickly paleness.
